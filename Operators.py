Instructions
Read the code and predict what it will display to the console.
Once you have made your prediction, run the program to see if
you were correct. Finally, be prepared to answer the following
questions...
* Does Python print the expressions as is (e.g., 2 + 2) or
  does it print the result of the expressions (e.g., 4)?
* How would you get the program to display the expression
  itself instead of the result? (Hint: Try using double
  quotes (") or single quotes (').)
* Did you notice Mr. Pawelski put spaces between the
  numbers and the operators? Are these necessary?
  (Hint: Try deleting the spaces and running the program again.)
  If not, why did Mr. Pawelski add spaces?
